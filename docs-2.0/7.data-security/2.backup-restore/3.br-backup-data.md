# Use BR to back up data

After BR is compiled, you can back up data of some specified graph spaces. This article introduces how to use BR to back up data.

## Prerequisites

To back up data with BR, do a check of these:

- The Nebula Graph services are ONLINE.
- Get the names of the graph spaces to do the backup. In this example, `nba` is used.
- From the `nebula-metad.conf` and `nebula-storaged.conf` files, get the IP addresses and ports of the meta and the storage servers. In this example,
  - For the meta server: `192.168.8.161:45500`
  - For the storage server: `192.168.8.161:44500`
- Your account on the BR machine can perform SSH login to the meta and the storage servers without password. For how to configure, you can refer to [RedHat Docs](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/passwordless-ssh "Click to go to RedHat website"). In this example, such an account named `nebula` on the BR machine is used.
- If you use Amazon S3 to store the backup files, make sure that the S3 CLI client is installed and configured on meta servers, storage servers, and the BR machine. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 with CLI](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-s3.html "Click to go to AWS website").
- If you use Alibaba Cloud OSS to store the backup files, make sure that the ossutil is installed on meta servers, storage servers, and the BR machine. For more information, see [Download and install ossutil](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/120075.htm#concept-303829 "Click to go to Alibaba Cloud website").
  > **NOTE**: If ossutil64 is used, create a symbolic link from ossutil64 to ossutil. For example, `ln -s /usr/local/bin/ossutil64 /usr/local/bin/ossutil`.
- If you want to store the backup files on the meta and/or storage servers, create a diretory with the same absolute path on these servers for the backup files and get its absolute path. In this example, `/home/user/backup/` is used.

## Procedure

To back up data of the specified graph spaces:

1. Edit the configuration file as follows.

    ```yaml
    meta_nodes:
     - # Set the IP address and the port of one metad process
      addrs: "192.168.8.161:45500"
      # Set the absolute path of the root directory where the metad process is installed
      root: "/usr/local/nebula/"
      # Set the absolute path of the data directory of the metad process
      data: "/usr/local/nebula/data/meta"
      # Set the account of the BR machine that is authorized to SSH the meta server
      user: "nebula"
    #- # If more than one metad processes run, refer the preceding configuration to add more
    #  addrs: "192.168.0.3:65500"
    #  root: "/usr/local/nebula/"
    #  data: "/usr/local/nebula/data/meta"
    #  user: "nebula"
    #- addrs: "192.168.0.4:62500"
    #  root: "/usr/local/nebula/"
    #  data: "/usr/local/nebula/data/meta"
    #  user: "nebula"

    storage_nodes:
     - # Set the IP address and the port of one storage server
      addrs: "192.168.8.161:44500"
      # Set the absolute path of the root directory where the storaged process is installed
      root: "/usr/local/nebula/"
      # Set the absolute path of the data directory of the storaged process
      data: "/usr/local/nebula/data/storage"
      # Set the account of the BR machine that is authorized to SSH the storage server
      user: "nebula"
    #- # If more than one storaged processes run, refer the preceding configuration to add more
    #  addrs: "192.168.0.3:44510"
    #  root: "/usr/local/nebula/"
    #  data: "/usr/local/nebula/data/storage"
    #  user: "nebula"
    #- addrs: "192.168.0.4:44520"
    #  root: "/usr/local/nebula/"
    #  data: "/usr/local/nebula/data/storage"
    #  user: "nebula"

    # Set the store directory for the backup files
    # If the backup files are stored locally, set 
    # backend: "local:///absolute/path/to/the/store/directory"
    # If Alibaba Cloud OSS is used, set
    # backend: "oss://nebulabackup"
    # If Amazon S3 is used, set
    backend: "s3://nebulabackup"

    # Set the graph spaces to be backed up.
    # If more than one graph spaces are necessary, set
    # space_names: ["space_name1", "space_name2", ..., "space_name"]
    space_name: ["nba"]
    ```

2. Change to the `nebula-storage/util/br/bin/` directory.

   ```bash
   cd nebula-storage/util/util/br/bin/
   ```

3. Back up data.

   ```bash
   ./br backup full --config "/absolute/path/to/the/backup/configuration/file.yaml`"
   ```
  
    Of this command:
  
     - `backup full`: To back up data.
     - `--config "/absolute/path/to/the/backup/configuration/file.yaml"`: Sets the absolute path of the configuration file.

    > **NOTE**: During the backup process, if the leader changes, an error will occur.

    When the backup is done, you can find the backup files with names of the `BACKUP_YY_MM_DD_HH_mm_SS` format in the backup store directory. In this example, in the `/home/user/backup/` directory, you can find a directory named `BACKUP_2020_11_30_20_47_44`.

4. Verify the data.

5. (Optional) By default, all the snapshots will be deleted when the backup is done. If errors occur during the deletion of these files, run this command to delete them.

   ```bash
   ./br cleanup --backup_name BACKUP_2020_11_30_20_47_44 --meta 192.168.8.161:45500
   ```

   Of this command:
   - `cleanup`: To delete all the temporary files from the meta and the storage servers.
   - `--back_name BACKUP_YY_MM_DD_HH_mm_SS`: Sets a backup directory name, indicating the command is run to delete the temporary files that were generated when this backup file is generated.
   - `--meta <IP address:port>`: Sets the IP address and the port of a meta server.
