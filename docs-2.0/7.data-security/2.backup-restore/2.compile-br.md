# Compile BR

For now, the BR is not provided as a package. You can compile the BR.

## Prerequisites

To compile the BR, do a check of these:

- [Go](https://github.com/golang/go "Click to go to GitHub") 1.14 or a later version is installed.
- make is installed.

## Procedure

To compile the BR, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `nebula-storage` repository to your machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-storage.git
   ```

2. Change to the `br` diretory.

   ```bash
   cd nebula-storage/util/br
   ```

3. Compile the BR.

   ```bash
   make build && make test
   ```

When the BR is compiled successfully, you can find the `br` binary file under the `nebula-storage/util/br/bin/` directory.
