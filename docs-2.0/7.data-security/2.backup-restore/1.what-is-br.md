# What is Backup & Restore

Backup & Restore (BR in short) is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool for you to back up data of graph spaces of Nebula Graph and to restore data from the backup files.

## Implementation

### Backup

To back up data, the BR sends a backup request to each metad process to trigger the backup process as follows:

1. The SSH login from the BR to the meta and the storage servers is verified. Besides, if remote store such as Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS is necessary, their client installation and configuration is verified.
2. The BR sends a request to create backup files.
3. The metad process is locked.
4. The metad process blocks writes to the specified graph spaces on the storaged process.
5. The metad process sends a request to storaged processes for the snapthot file names.
6. The metad process scans local RocksDB files and outputs SST files.
7. The metad process cancels blocking writes to the graph spaces on the storaged process.
8. The metad process sends response to the BR with the metad data including the thrift format, partition information of the graph spaces, and the log commit ID of each partition, and the snapshot information including the catalog of the snapshots of each storaged process, their SST file names of the meta server, and the backup file names.
9. The metad process is unlocked.
10. The BR SSH to the meta server where the leader locates and all the storage servers and backs up files. If Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS is used, the backfiles are uploaded to the remote store.
11. If Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS is used, the BR calls commands to upload files to the remote store.
12. The BR sends a request to clean the snapshots in meta servers and storage servers.

When backup files are generated, the file names are generated automatically. A file name is in the format of `BACKUP_YY_MM_DD_HH_mm_SS`, of which,

- `BACKUP`: Indicats the files are bakup files.
- `YY_MM_DD_HH_mm_SS`: Indicates the timestamp when a file is generated.

### Restore

The restoration process is as follows:

1. The SSH login from the BR to the meta and the storage servers is verified. Besides, if remote store such as Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS is necessary, their client installation and configuration is verified.
2. The BR downloads the meta data of the backup files from the remote store or other external store.
3. The BR verifies the topology of the cluster.
4. The BR stops the Meta Service and the Storage Service remotely.
5. The BR SSH logs in to meta and storage servers to remove the existing data files.
6. When data files are removed, the BR SSH logs in to meta and storage servers and downloads the backup files from the remote store or other external store.
7. When the backup files are downloaded, the BR starts the Meta Service.
8. The BR calls the `br restore` command to change the partition information of the specified metad processes.
9. The BR starts the Storage Service.

## Features

- Supports storing backup files in local disks (SSD or HDD), Alibaba Cloud OSS, and Amazon S3.
- Supports backing up data of the minimum one graph space.

## Limitations

- Supports Nebula Graph v2.0.0-GA and later versions only.
- Supports full backup, but not incremental backup.
- Supports restoration of data on clusters of the same topologies only.
- SSH login is a must for backup and restoration.

## How to use

To use BR, follow these steps:

1. [Compile BR](2.compile-br.md).
2. [Use BR to back up data and store them in backup files](3.br-backup-data.md).
3. [Use BR to restore data from backup files](4.br-restore-data.md).
